Script to evaluate speed of binary search in comparison to normal linear search.

Give it some tries and experiment.

Spoiler alert:

Sorting the list is the most time-consuming process, so binary search is only recommended 
when the list is already sorted. For bigger lists, binary search is way faster (sorting excluded), 
so binary search definitively has it's place.
